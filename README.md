How to use:
1. Play all tests

Automated tests:
1. Valid and invalid user login
2. Adding food item to cart
3. Removing food item from cart

These functionalities were automated because we decided they were the most important for the application as they would get used every day. 
Such tests would have to be done after every change, so it is obvious they should be automated.

Due to time constraints and inability to create new users, these tests are very vulnerable to changes. Setup for tests is very rudimentary, more robust setup is required (new user creation, new separate food provider created).
More tests were planned (admin functions) but they were cut after we saw there was not enought time.
